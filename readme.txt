1.) Part 1
The source code is in the lab1p1.c file. To make it easy to test i have created a bash script to test the code.

*To make the script executable -> chmod +x test_lab1p1.sh
*To run the script             -> ./test_lab1p1.sh

2.) Part 2
Here also I have created a test file.

*To make the script executable -> chmod +x test_lab1p2.sh
*To run the script             -> ./test_lab1p2.sh
